Chromium 0.9.11
 - added high scores. Default is to have high scores per-user, but the 
   CHROMIUM_SCORE environment variable can be set to a common file for
   site-wide scores (file must be read/writable for all users, of course).
 - score was not resetting to 0 on new game. oops.
 - if mixed data/music CD tracks, data tracks are now skipped

Chromium 0.9.10
 - fixed supershields remaining after suicide 'game over'
 - fixed stupid buffer overflow typo in setup app.
 - put in hack for detecting CD music tracks - SDL is adding 2
   to the track type on some copied CDRs (will be fixed in SDL 1.1.7+)
 - added support for setting CDROM volume through AL extensions. 
 - fixed up Win32 build
 - some GL tweaks to improve visuals on 1.1 GL drivers.
 - fixed audio destructor from bombing when audio is disabled.
 - added Macintosh changes from Max Horn.
 - stopped modifying musicMax with playlist when CD is enabled.
 - added SDL_mixer option from Darrell Walisser so there is a decent
   audio option for those platforms that OpenAL doesn't support very well.
 - rearranged the Audio class because things were getting too messy.

Chromium 0.9.9c
 - fixed persistent exhaust when game over
 - fixed CDROM w/ data only tracks
 - added half-assed check for Qt in configure, and made it an enable option.
Chromium 0.9.9b
 - added Qt version check for using QSGIStyle in the setup app
Chromium 0.9.9a
 - changed 'configure' to './configure' for OPENAL_CONFIG_OPTS in config.mak
 - fixed 'suicide while dead' bug. 
Chromium 0.9.9
 - added CD music support
 - added PlayList support - a simple list of WAV, MP3 and/or OGG files 
   (depending on what options are compiled into OpenAL) that are used
   for background music.
 - created the 'chromium-setup' Qt app that can set all options for Chromium, 
   and serves as an easy way to create the PlayList (browse for files, 
   play them, rearrange the list, etc). 
 - wrote a 'configure' script (not autoconf) that attempts to determine what
   components are available for OpenAL support
 - audio tweaks.
 - integrated patches from Torbjörn Andersson and improved the pause mode. 
 - changed capitalization of dirs in data for consistency.

Chromium 0.9.8
 - too many changes to list in detail...
 - new enemies, new bosses
 - added self destruct option (double right-click)
 - some major code rearrangement
 - added gamma adjustment
 - graphics improvements
 - added 'auto_speed' flag - when enabled, it tries to maintain the proper
   speed of the game, regardless of framerate. Can result in jerky playback
   if framerate varies a lot, though (disabled by default).
 - reversed default audio orientation. My stereo had its wires crossed ;)
 - added an option to build with GLUT instead of SDL, but decided not to
   make it the default. GLUT's 'game mode' is not well documented or 
   ubiquitous.

Chromium 0.9.7
 - code cleanup for portability. Compiles cleanly on Win32, IRIX and 
   RH7 (with audio disabled because of OpenAL issues) now.
 - Changes from Sven M. Hallberg to separate Damage and Shield alpha.
 - Redid the menu text geometry source a couple of times due to various 
   compiler difficulties.
 - Reorganized some things so that GLUT can replace SDL at a later
   date. I'm not really using much of SDL's functionality, and a GLUT
   based project will be easier to build under Windows. SDL will remain
   an option, however.
 - Fixed ExploPop sound orientation when swap_stereo was enabled.
 - Fixed stupid command line args goof.
 
Chromium 0.9.6
 - fixed sound glitch at startup. still glitches when fullscreen is toggled.
 - added mouse speed to menu. When DGA is enabled in the X server and Chromium 
   is run full screen, the mouse responds very differently to windowed
   mode. I'm assuming it's an SDL init thing.
 - added "swap_stereo" flag to ~/.chromium init file. Set it to '1' to flip
   audio output.
 - Graphics tweaks
 - Gameplay tweaks
 - Added joystick support (but it sucks - use the mouse)

Chromium 0.9.5 
 - Initial release
