============

The purpose of this project is to provide a central location for "native" (ie: Win32 - not WinRT) Windows RT development libraries / applications that I have ported. Ports of commonly used open source libraries will be hosted here in a effort to speed along development and release of other native Windows RT applications. Where possible or required, efforts will be made to include a binary and source release of each library / application. In many cases the source code has been 'hacked together' to get clean builds. This means that some functionality may have been specifically disabled or compiled out in order to achieve a successful (sometimes only partially working) build.

Because Microsoft has chosen to 'lock down' Windows RT such that only Microsoft signed Win32 applications can be run, all the ported apps here require a jailbreak in order to work. The following jailbreaks are available:


1. The original, Windows RT 8.0 only, jailbreak exists thanks to clrokr and netham45 from XDA. You can find this jailbreak in the repo, or you can get it from XDA directly -- [http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2092158](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2092158)



1. For Windows 8.0/8.1 RT, another jailbreak exists thanks to Myriachan from XDA. You can find this jailbreak in the repo, or you can find on XDA -- [http://forum.xda-developers.com/windows-8-rt/rt-development/jailbreak-exploit-released-t3225051](http://forum.xda-developers.com/windows-8-rt/rt-development/jailbreak-exploit-released-t3225051)


**Note:** The Windows 8.1 RT jailbreak has been patched and you may need to remove various Windows updates before it will work correctly. You can read about this here: [http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=65091099&postcount=2](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=65091099&postcount=2)

**Please note that the various open source libraries / applications hosted here fall under their own individual licensing limitations, restrictions, etc. Please carefully read and adhere to the license of each one before downloading them from here. Should anyone have any concerns regarding the hosting of a particular library / application within this project or feels there is a violation of its licensing, please contact the project coordinator (bfosterjr) to have the issue resolved or the offending library / application removed.**
